The unique device is a Natural alternative for using drugs to treat nasal congestion symptoms. The Rhinotherm Ultra 3 device is a new generation of a previous model which had been sold to clinicians around the world. Several years of development resulted in an improved technology and re-designed device suitable to the private consumer. The device is based on hyperthermia technology, operates on highly important principle of delivering 100% water- saturated pressurized air at a temperature around 43°C (110°F) directly to the nasal passages via a hand-held tube. Duration of a treatment is only 20 to 25 minutes and on average offers the patient a fast relief that can last up to several days even several weeks. When suffering from Nasal congestion or during allergy season, between two or three treatments per day are recommended for maximum relief.</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"right\">\n                        <span className=\"img\"></span>\n                        <div className=\"content\">\n                            <p>delivering 100% water- saturated pressurized air at a temperature around 43°C (110°F) directly to the nasal passages via a hand-held tube.</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div className=\"five\">\n                <div className=\"title\" onClick={() => {\n                    props.history.push({\n                        pathname: '/studies'\n                    })\n                }}>\n                    <h3>CLINICAL</h3>\n                    <h3>STUDIES</h3>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"text\">\n                    <p>Clinical studies conducted in USA, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, UK, Israel and Japan showed impressive results in treating both children and adults suffering from all kinds of nasal congestion, including viral congestion, chronic congestion, sinusitis and allergies。</p>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Double blind prospective design</li>\n                        <li>990 participants</li>\n                        <li>Israel, U.K, France, Germany, Italy ,Holland, Japan</li>\n                        <li>75%-80% reported significant symptom relief</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Home","import './index.scss'\n\nfunction About() {\n\n\n    return(\n        <div className=\"about\">\n            <div className=\"first\"></div>\n            <div className=\"two\">\n                <h3 className=\"title\">RHINOTHERM </h3>\n                <p>Established in 1985, developed and patented medical device to treat patients suffering from nasal congestion.

At times, many new phage are created quickly, while at other times, new phage are formed only several bacterial generations later. In the early 1950s André Lwoff successfully explained how this process, known as lysogeny, works. The bacteriophage's genes are incorporated into the bacteria's genetic material, but remain latent until a trigger factor causes new phage to be formed. André Lwoff also showed that ultraviolet light can be one such factor.</p>\n                <p>Professor Andre Lwoff studied the effects of temperature on virus development and infection, and the Research team in Israel discovered that hyperthermia was effective in nasal congestion.</p>\n                <h4>Treatment of Perenial Allergic Rhinitis by Local Hyperthermia </h4>\n                <p>Aharon Yerushalmi, Sergiu Karman and Andre Lwoff   Israel/France</p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>—  95 patients (53 males 42 females)</li>\n                    <li>—  Mean age 32 (12-72)</li>\n                    <li>—  Typical complaints for at least one year</li>\n                    <li>—  Positive skin tests (at least one allergen)</li>\n                    <li>—  Exclusion criteria – steroid treatment, sinusitis, asthma, anatomic obstruction, respiratory\n                        infection</li>\n                    <li>—  Double blind randomized prospective trial</li>\n                    <li>—  Treatment group – 43℃ air, Placebo group – room temperature air</li>\n                    <li>—  three 30 min sessions (2 hour interval) in one day</li>\n                    <li>—   F/U 1, 7, 30 days</li>\n                </ul>\n                <div className=\"img\">\n                    <span></span>\n                    <span></span>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default AndreLwoff","import './clinical-studies.scss'\nfunction ClinicalStudies() {\n\n\n    return(\n        <div className=\"studies\">\n            <div className=\"first\">\n                <div className=\"text\">\n                    <div className=\"title\">\n                        <h3>NASAL HYPERTHERMIA AND SIMPLE IRRIGATION FOR</h3>\n                        <h3>PERENNIAL RHINITIS – CHANGES IN INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS</h3>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Conducted by : John W.
