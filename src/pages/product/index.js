                <p>RHINOTHERM based on the work of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Professor Andre Lwoff, 1965 Nobel Prize winner (Pasteur Institute of
                        Paris) - studied the effects of temperature on virus development and infection.</li>
                    <li>Dr. A. Yerushalmi from the Weizmann Institute of Science.</li>
                    <li>Research team in Israel discovered that hyperthermia was effective in nasal congestion.
                        RHINOTHERM development.</li>
                    <li>Improved technology - reduced cost RHINOTHERM  for home use.</li>

                    <li>Duration of  treatment 15 to 30 minutes</li>
                    <li>Symptom relief for several days up to one month.</li>
                    <li>RHINOTHERM = Drug Free Treatment.</li>
                    <li>Low cost – home, office, schools, hospitals</li>

                        <p>Most people who suffer from allergy symptoms find relief with antihistamines and traditional cold relief medicine. These can often cause unwanted and uncomfortable side effects to the point where many people would rather suffer with the symptoms than use the remedy.
                            But now there is a new source of relief, which uses no drugs, just water or saline solution, thus preventing adverse side effects caused by drugs. Based on the principle of hyperthermia, water- saturated pressurized air is delivered directly to the nasal passages.</p>
                        <p>This new relief is the "Rhinotherm Ultra 2." Developed by a team of scientists and engineers, the Rhinotherm has proven to be effective for relieving the nasal congestion in numerous clinical studies performed worldwide. Relief after a 15 to 30 minutes treatment can last up to several days. The temperature of the water and the duration of treatment are monitored by a small digital unit on the appliance.</p>
                        <p>The Rhinotherm appliance was subjected to over ten clinical trials (some of them on a randomized double-blind basis), conducted in eight countries, ranging from Japan and China in the East to Europe and Canada in the West, and was successful in over 75% of the cases in increasing nasal patency and decreasing nasal discharge. An asthmatic attack occurred in less than 1% of asthmatic patients during treatment.</p>
                        <p>The "Rhinothemi Ultra 2" can be used by both adults and children, although pregnant women should consult their physicianf.</p>

                        <p>Is a novel medical device designed for the consumer market and can be used in every home, school, office and geriatric care for the treatment of Nasal congestion, Allergies, Sinusitis and more.</p>
                        <p>The unique device is a Natural alternative for using drugs to treat nasal congestion symptoms. The Rhinotherm Ultra 3 device is a new generation of a previous model which had been sold to clinicians around the world.</p>
                        <p>Several years of development resulted in an improved technology and re-designed device suitable to the private consumer.</p>
                        <p>The device is based on hyperthermia technology, operates on highly important principle of delivering 100% water- saturated pressurized air at a temperature around 43°C (110°F) directly to the nasal passages via a hand-held tube.</p>
                        <p>Duration of a treatment is only 20 to 25 minutes and on average offers the patient a fast relief that can last up to several days even several weeks.</p>
                        <p>When suffering from a Cold or during allergy season, between two or three treatments per week are recommended for maximum relief.</p>
