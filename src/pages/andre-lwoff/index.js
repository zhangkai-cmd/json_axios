                <p>Bacteriophages are viruses that attach themselves to bacteria, emptying their genetic material into them. At times, many new phage are created quickly, while at other times, new phage are formed only several bacterial generations later. In the early 1950s André Lwoff successfully explained how this process, known as lysogeny, works. The bacteriophage's genes are incorporated into the bacteria's genetic material, but remain latent until a trigger factor causes new phage to be formed. André Lwoff also showed that ultraviolet light can be one such factor.</p>
                <p>Professor Andre Lwoff studied the effects of temperature on virus development and infection, and the Research team in Israel discovered that hyperthermia was effective in nasal congestion.</p>
