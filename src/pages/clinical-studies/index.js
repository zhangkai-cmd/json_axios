                <p>Local hyperthermia or inhalation of heated water vapor is often recommended as a home remedy for various nasal disorders such as the common cold and allergic rhinitis.</p>
                <p>With technical advances in vapor generation(as tested with RHINOTHERM ULTRA II) , water can be heated to a range of 41℃ to 43℃ / (110°F) with variation in particle size.</p>
                <p>The effect of inhaled heated vapor(as tested with RHINOTHERM ULTRA II) treatments was studied in patients with perennial rhinitis for changes in nasal airflow and patient perception of symptoms.</p>
                <p>Thirty symptomatic patients underwent three treatments at weekly intervals: (1) a large particle heated water vapor (as tested with RHINOTHERM ULTRA II) at 43℃ / (110°F) for 20 minutes with a particle size of 4 to 8 microns, (2) a molecular water vapor at 41℃ for 20 minutes which is a vapor phase, and (3) nasal irrigation.</p>
                <p>Nasal airflow increased after both vapor treatments at four and six hours (P &lt; .05) whereas airflow decreased after simple nasal irrigation treatment.</p>
                <p>Rhinitis symptoms improved after vapor(as tested with RHINOTHERM ULTRA II) treatments but not with nasal irrigation. Patients preferred the molecular water vapor(as tested with RHINOTHERM ULTRA II) treatment over the large particle vapor treatment and nasal irrigation by 2:1 margin.</p>
                <p>This study demonstrated the usefulness of heated vapor(as tested with RHINOTHERM ULTRA II) treatments in improving rhinitis symptoms and nasal airflow.</p>
                <h5>As Noted in the Full Original Study*</h5>
                <p>"This study evaluated two different heated vapor treatments compared with simple nasal lavage or irrigation since saline solution nasal sprays have been reported to be beneficial for rhinitis.</p>
                <p>The heated treatments were at 41℃ for 20 min with a molecular water vapor, at 43℃ / (110°F) for 20 min with a large particle water vapor ( RhinoTherm), and simple nasal irrigation (using a Water Pik) at temperature of 39℃."</p>

                <h5>The results obtained were as follows:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. During the nasal local hyperthermia, the temperature in the nasal airway up to the nasopharynx remained at above 43°C.</li>
                    <li>2. The mean temperature on the surface of the nasal mucosa was from 37°C to 38°C</li>
                    <li>3. The mucociliary activity in vivo was not disturbed by the hyperthermic load at 43°C</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>We conclude , from these results, that the nasal local hyperthermia is applicable without the disturbance of the mucociliary activity, and that the local circulation of the blood and the autonomic nervous system also should be considerable as the mechanism of this treatment.</h5>
